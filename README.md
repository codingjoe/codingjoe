### [Consider sponsoring my open-source efforts ❤️](https://github.com/sponsors/codingjoe)

Hi! I'm a Berlin-based open-source developer and CTO. Most of my work is dedicated peoples lives easier, including developers.
That implies answering numerous questions or building tools like [relint](https://github.com/codingjoe/relint) or maintaining and supporting other great community packages.

Most of my efforts gravitate around the Python and Django community, though my most famous invention remains a Java application called [MusicBeam](https://musicbeam.org).
